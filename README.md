# IntroToWekinator
This is an intro project to use Wekinator with OpenFrameworks. 
1. Clone this project in openFrameworks -> apps -> myApps
2. Download [Wekinator](http://www.wekinator.org/downloads/).
3. Download [Sound synthesis](http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/~mas01rf/WekinatorDownloads/wekinator_examples/executables/mac/outputs/Processing_FMSynth_3ContinuousOutputs_Mac.zip) project. 
4. Now, you have all the pieces to run it. Here's a quick [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPV-gCqy9j4) where Rebecca explains how to use the Wekinator app to connect the two programs you got. For the X-Y program, rather than what she's using, you are using the openFrameworks program. 

Have fun.
